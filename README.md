# Good morning, and in case I don't see ya: Good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

I'm Yashwanth, saying hi from India! Just like a friendly neighbor, I'm here to share a bit about me.

ðŸ”­ I'm into AI and tech stuff, kinda like digging into the cool brains of computers. Right now, I'm hanging out in the world of Artificial Intelligence, learning and tinkering with it.

ðŸŒ± You know what's exciting? The tech world keeps changing like the weather, and I find it super interesting. I'm also into making stuff look nice on screens, that's UI/UX design.

ðŸŽ§ Oh, and guess what's playing? "Sunflower" by Post Malone and Swae Lee. The beats keep me company while I'm on this tech journey.

Thanks for stopping by, neighbor! ðŸ˜„
